**VProfile - Automated Multi-Tier Web Application Stack**

---

### Description

The VProfile project involved setting up and managing a complex multi-tier web application stack on a local machine using Oracle VM VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Git Bash. The stack included various services such as Nginx, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcache, ElasticSearch, and MySQL.

### Key Achievements

- **Automated Setup:** Developed an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution to automate the setup process, making it repeatable and efficient.
- **Service Integration:** Successfully integrated and configured multiple services to work seamlessly together.
- **Local Environment:** Enabled safe and extensive research and development on a local machine without the risks associated with making changes on live servers.
- **Efficient Provisioning:** Used Vagrant for efficient provisioning and management of virtual environments.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implemented robust security measures, including MySQL secure installation and firewall configuration.
- **Source Code Management:** Utilized Git for version control and source code management.

### Tools & Technologies

- **Hypervisor:** Oracle VM VirtualBox
- **Automation:** Vagrant
- **CLI:** Git Bash
- **IDE:** Sublime Text
- **Web Server:** Nginx
- **Application Server:** Tomcat
- **Broker/Queue:** RabbitMQ
- **DB Caching:** Memcache
- **Indexing/Search Service:** ElasticSearch
- **Database:** MySQL

This project not only streamlined the development workflow but also enhanced my skills in automation, infrastructure management, and multi-tier application deployment.

**DevOps: EMart App - A Microservice Showcase Leveraging NGINX and Docker**

---

### Description

The EMart App demonstrates the power of microservice architecture in building a scalable and maintainable application. This report delves into the app's architecture, focusing on the NGINX API gateway and its role in routing traffic to independent microservices written in Node.js (EMart API) and Java (Books API). Each microservice interacts with its dedicated database (MongoDB for EMart API and MySQL for Books API), fostering loose coupling and independent scaling.

### Tools & Technologies

- **Web Server:** NGINX
- **Microservices:** Node.js (EMart API), Java (Books API)
- **Databases:** MongoDB (EMart API), MySQL (Books API)
- **Containerization:** Docker
